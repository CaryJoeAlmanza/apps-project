# DESCRIPTION
This project is an emulation of the table-top gambling game craps. This virtualized version of the game allows the player to learn the game, familiarize themselves with the lingo, and place bets. We used an authentic craps table as a background, and all the real wagers from the game in order for the game to be not only easily understandable for expirenced craps players practicing, but also a great learning expirence for new players learning.
